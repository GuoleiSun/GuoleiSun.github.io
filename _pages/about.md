I am a PhD candidate under supervision of [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjQ4LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html) in [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Previously, I obtained a master degree from [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) and a bachelor degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn). After that, I have spent wonderful times as a research engineer at [IIAI](http://www.inceptioniai.org), working with [Prof. Fahad Shahbaz Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home), [Prof. Hisham Cholakkal](href="https://mbzuai-cv-lab.netlify.app/author/dr.-hisham-cholakkal/), and [Prof. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io).

My research interests lie in video understanding, semantic segmentation, scene understanding and image restoration. I have served as a reviewer for top-tier vision conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, NeurIPS) as well as leading journals (TPAMI, TIP).
