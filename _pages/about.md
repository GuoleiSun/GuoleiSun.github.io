I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Before that, I obtained my PhD degree under supervision of [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjQ4LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html) in the same lab. During my PhD, I had spent time at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/) and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). Previously, I obtained a master degree from [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) and a bachelor degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn). I have also spent wonderful time as a research engineer (research track) at [IIAI](http://www.inceptioniai.org), working with [Prof. Fahad Shahbaz Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home), [Prof. Hisham Cholakkal](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/hisham-cholakkal), and [Prof. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io).

My research interests lie in video understanding, semantic segmentation, scene understanding, multi-modal AI, and image generation/restoration. I have served as a reviewer for top-tier CV/ML/AI conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR) as well as leading journals (TPAMI, IJCV, TIP).

<strong>Open positions</strong>: If you are a master/PhD student in Switzerland or globally, and you're interested in collaborating, feel free to send me (guolei.sun@vision.ee.ethz.ch) an email with your CV. I am open to discussion and collaboration.
